| **Feature**                | **Pass by Value**                              | **Pass by Reference**                           |

| **Definition**              | The function gets a copy of the argument value. Changes made to the parameter do not affect the argument. | The function gets a reference (or address) of the argument. Changes made to the parameter affect the original argument. |
| **Memory Usage**            | Uses more memory because a copy of the variable is created. | Uses less memory since no copy of the variable is created. |
| **Effect on Original**      | Does not affect the original variable. | Modifies the original variable. |
| **Performance**             | May be slower, especially with large data types (like large structures or arrays). | Faster, especially with large data types, as no copying is involved. |
| **Syntax**                  | Function parameters receive values directly. | Function parameters receive references (using `&` in C++). |
| **Use Case**                | When you donâ€™t need to modify the argument passed to the function. | When you want to modify the argument passed to the function. |
